## 🧠 AI Architecture & How It Works

### 🔄 Intelligent Processing Pipeline

1. **Document Processing**: Extracts text from uploaded resume files using pdfplumber and python-docx
2. **LLM-Powered Extraction**: 
   - Uses **Hugging Face Flan-T5-Large** to intelligently extract skills, experience, and education
   - Structured prompts ensure accurate section-wise analysis
   - Smart fallback to regex patterns if API is unavailable
3. **Semantic Embedding**: Converts extracted text to vector embeddings using **Sentence Transformers**
4. **AI Similarity Scoring**: Calculates cosine similarity between resume and job description embeddings
5. **Results Visualization**: Presents findings in an intuitive interface with interactive charts

### 🤖 AI Models Used

- **Flan-T5-Large**: Google's instruction-tuned LLM for text understanding and extraction
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2**: Microsoft's sentence transformer for semantic embeddings
- **Cosine Similarity**: Mathematical approach for measuring semantic closeness

## 🔍 Features Deep Dive

### 🎯 Advanced AI Matching Algorithm
- **LLM-Enhanced Understanding**: Goes beyond keyword matching using state-of-the-art language models
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands job requirements and candidate profiles semantically
- **Multi-Modal Extraction**: Separate analysis for skills, experience, and education sections
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Weighted similarity scores with realistic percentage scaling
- **Robust Fallback System**: Continues working even when external APIs are down

### Supported File Formats
- PDF documents (processed with pdfplumber)
- Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
- Plain text input

### Local Development
```bash
streamlit run main_app.py --server.port 8501
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
- **HF API Token Missing**: Set `HF_API_TOKEN` in Streamlit secrets or environment variables
- **LLM API Timeouts**: App will fallback to regex-based extraction automatically
- **PDF Processing Errors**: Some complex PDFs might need manual text extraction
- **Slow Performance**: Large transformer models may require more memory
- **Plotly Charts**: If charts don't display, ensure plotly is installed: `pip install plotly`

### Deployment Issues
- Make sure `requirements.txt` is properly formatted
- **Configure HF_API_TOKEN in Streamlit Cloud secrets**
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8-3.11 for Streamlit Cloud)
- Verify all imports are included in requirements
- Monitor API rate limits for Hugging Face calls
